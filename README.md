## Coding Interview Problems Overview
One of the most intimidating parts of getting a software enginnering job in industry is the technical interview. Luckily, I have programmed solutions to some of the most common coding interview questions. These solutions include:
* [Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/), which runs in O(n) time. 
* [The Coin Change Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/description/), which runs in O(n * S) time.
* The Duplicate XOR Problem I, which runs in O(n) time.
* The Duplicate XOR Problem II, which runs in O(n) time.
* The Splitwise Problem, which runs in O(M + N log N) time.

## Leetcode Solutions Overview
The largest part of this repository are the LeetCode solutions that I have solved and provided the solutions for here. There are 30+ LeetCode solutions in this repository, some of these include:
* [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/), which runs in O(n) time.
* [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/description/), which runs in O(n) time.
* [Deepest Leaves Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/deepest-leaves-sum/description/), which runs in O(n) time).

## Library Overview
In this repository I also have a library I created for a vairety of Data Structures' solutions. There are multiple libraries for whatever suits your needs. These library solutions include:
* [Graph Algorithms](https://github.com/rachitiitr/DataStructures-Algorithms/tree/master/Library/Graph)
* [Tree Algorithms](https://github.com/rachitiitr/DataStructures-Algorithms/tree/master/Library/Tree)
* [Math Library](https://github.com/rachitiitr/DataStructures-Algorithms/tree/master/Library/Math)
